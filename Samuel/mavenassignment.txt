Difference between Gradle and Maven

1)Gradle uses a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) for creating project structure, while Maven uses Extensible Makeup Language (XML) for its project configuration.

2)Gradle performs better/faster than Maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. Maven does not create temporary files during software creation, and thus is slower.

3)Gradle is highly customizable as it supports a variety of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) while Maven serves a limited number of developers and is less customizable.

4)Gradle supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy while Maven supports software development in Java, Scala, C#, and Ruby
