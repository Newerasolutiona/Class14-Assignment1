Difference between Gradle and Maven

1)Gradle uses a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) for creating project structure, while Maven uses Extensible Makeup Language (XML) for its project configuration.


2)Gradle performs better/faster than Maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. Maven does not create temporary files during software creation, and thus is slower.
