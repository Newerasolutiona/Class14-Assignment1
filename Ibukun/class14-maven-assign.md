DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GRADLE AND MAVEN
1. Base: Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects. Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software.
2. Configuration: Gadle uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure. Maven uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure.
3. Focus: Gradle focuses on developing applications by adding new features to them. Maven focuses on developing applications in a given time limit.
4. Performance: Gradle performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. Maven does not create local temporary files during software creation, and is hence – slower.
5. Java Compilation: Gradle avoids compilation. Maven does compilation.
6. Usability: Gradle is a new tool, which requires users to spend a lot of time to get used to it. Maven is a known tool for many users and is easily available.
7. Customization: Gradle is highly customizable as it supports a variety of IDE’s. Maven serves a limited amount of developers and is not that customizable.
8. Languages supported: Gradle supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy. Maven supports software development in Java, Scala, C#, and Ruby.
