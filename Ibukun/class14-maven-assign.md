DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GRADLE AND MAVEN
1. Base: Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects. Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software.
2. Configuration: Gadle uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure. Maven uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure.
