DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GRADLE AND MAVEN
1. Base: Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects. Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software.
2. Configuration: Gadle uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure. Maven uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure.
3. Focus: Gradle focuses on developing applications by adding new features to them. Maven focuses on developing applications in a given time limit.
4. Performance: Gradle performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. Maven does not create local temporary files during software creation, and is hence â€“ slower.
