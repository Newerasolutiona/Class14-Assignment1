DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAVEN AMD GRADLE:

Gradle is based on domain-specific language (DSL), used for a specific purpose to solve a specific problem, while Maven is based on general programming language (GPL), used for any number of purposes, to solve any number of problems.
Gradle creates a project structure using a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language), while Maven uses XML (Extensible Markup Language) to create project structures.
