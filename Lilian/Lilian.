The difference between Maven and Gradle
1. Gradle is faster than Maven because of it's incrementality; it tracks inputs and output of files and runs only what is necessary, and where possible and only processes files that changed.
2. Gradle is written in  groovy language while Maven uses java
3. Gradle is easily customizable than Maven
