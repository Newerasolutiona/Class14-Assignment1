It works on Java and a Groovy-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developing the project structure. Gradle supports the creation of mobile and web applications with testing and deploying on various platforms. With its functionality, it is preferred as an official tool for developing Android applications

Maven: Maven is an open-source project management tool that helps us to create different software in the lifecycle used by this tool. This tool focuses on the standardization (i.e.) development of the software in a standard layout within a short duration of time. With this, we can create Java projects but is compatible to be used for other languages too. Maven uses Extensible Markup language(XML) for the structuring of the application.
