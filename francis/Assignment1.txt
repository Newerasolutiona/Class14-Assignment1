##Difference between Marven and Gradle

1. Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software, and relates the goal 
   to a project phase. while Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language 
   projects. The goal with gradle is to add feature to a project.

2. Maven focuses on developing applications within deadlines.
   while Gradle focuses on developing applications by adding additional features.

3. Maven uses Extensible Markup Language or XML for making the project structure. 
   Maven uses an XML file for declaring the project and its dependencies.
   while Gradle uses Groovy-based Domain-Specific language for making the project 
   structure.

4. Maven supports development in languages like Scala, C#, and Ruby.
   while Gradle supports development in languages like Java, C, C++, and Groovy.

5. Maven provides a limited number of parameters and resources; it can serve a 
   limited number of developers and is not much customizable.
   while Gradle is highly customizable and provides an extensive range of 
   IDE support builds. We can use Gradle for native development with C/C++.

6. Maven has a slower build time since it does not use build-cache, which 
   means it does not create local temporary files during software creation 
   hence uses ample time.
   while Gradle performs better than Maven as we optimize it for tracking only 
   current running tasks, which means it only works on the tasks that have been 
   changed to give a better performance.
