Diffrence between Gradle and Maven

GRADLE: automation system that uses a Groovy-based DSL (domain-specific language )
MAVEN : software project management system that is primarily used for java projects.

GRADLE: does not use an XML file for declaring the project configuration.
MAVEN: uses an XML file for declaring the project, its dependencies, the build order, and its required plugin

GRADLE: based on a graph of task dependencies that do the work.
MAVEN: based on the phases of the fixed and linear model.
