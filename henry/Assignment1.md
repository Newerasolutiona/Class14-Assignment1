What are the differences between Gradle and Maven?

1. Maven uses POM via XML, while Gradle uses Groovy via Gradle build files.

2. Gradle scripts are typically a lot shorter and a lot cleaner than Maven scripts.

3. Maven was created by Jason van Zyl while Gradle was founded by Hans Dockter.

4. In order to use Maven a local Maven must be installed on the machine which allows for less clutter in the repo directory, while Gradle uses a wrapper script so it does not require a local installation but it does require a bit more directories in the repository when being used.
