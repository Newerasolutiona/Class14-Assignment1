(4)Performance:
-Maven does not create local temporary files during software creation, and hence it's slower.
-Gradle performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task.

(5) Java Compilation:
-Maven makes it necessary to compile.
-Gradle avoids compilation.

(6) Usability:
-Maven is a known tool for many users and is easily available.
-Gradle is a new tool, which requires users to spend a lot of time to get used to it.

(7) Customization:
