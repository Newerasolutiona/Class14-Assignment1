-Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects.

(2) Configuration:

-Gradle uses a Groovy-based Domain specific language(DSL) for creating project structure.

(3) Maven focuses on developing applications in agiven time limit, while Gradle focuses on developing applications by adding new features to them.

(4)Performance:
-Maven does not create local temporary files during software creation, and hence it's slower.
-Gradle performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task.
